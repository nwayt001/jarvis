- Make the text to speech faster.
- Increase the amount of tools that Jarvis has.
- Think of more use cases for the Jarvis agent.

Jarvis task idea

Daily Productivity

  - Morning briefing - "JARVIS, give me my morning update" (weather, calendar, news headlines, stock
   prices)
  - Smart reminders - Set context-aware reminders that trigger based on location/time/activity
  - Email triage - Summarize unread emails and draft responses
  - Meeting prep - Pull relevant docs/notes before meetings, generate talking points

  Development Workflow

  - Code review assistant - "JARVIS, review my latest commit and check for security issues"
  - Dependency tracker - Monitor and alert about outdated packages or security vulnerabilities
  - Server monitoring - Check system resources, running processes, disk space
  - Git workflow - Auto-commit with smart messages, PR summaries, merge conflict resolution

  Home Automation

  - Smart home control - Integrate with HomeKit/Alexa/Google Home APIs
  - Energy monitoring - Track power usage patterns and suggest optimizations
  - Security system - Monitor network traffic, alert on unusual activity

  Research & Learning

  - Paper summarizer - Fetch and summarize academic papers or documentation
  - Learning assistant - Create flashcards, quiz you on topics, track progress
  - Project researcher - Gather info on new technologies/frameworks before starting projects

  Cool Advanced Features

  - Voice-controlled coding - "JARVIS, refactor this function to use async/await"
  - Ambient awareness - Use system events (low battery, high CPU) to proactively help
  - Multi-modal input - Process screenshots/images you share ("What's wrong with this UI?")
  - Conversation memory - Remember context across sessions using a vector database

  Which of these sound most useful to you? I can help implement any of them.
